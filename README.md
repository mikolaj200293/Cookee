# Cookee

Cookee is an application where each user can manage his or her own and their loved ones' diet plan and generate the shopping lists necessary for its implementation.

Each user can create an account, thanks to which he can define his own food products with the number of calories calculated based on their macronutrients. Based on the defined products it is possible to create any recipes, for any number of people.

The application allows you to define profiles of people for whom you want to prepare a nutrition plan. Based on the caloric requirements of the people for whom the user wants to prepare meals and the caloric content of the defined recipes, it is possible to create a nutrition plan of any length.

The application allows the user to assign any recipe to any meal of the day, in any number of servings. When choosing dishes, the user cannot exceed the daily number of calories based on the needs of the people for whom the plan is created.

If the number of calories for the entire day is too low, the user has the option of supplementing the number of calories to the desired value by increasing the number of servings of the selected dish.

For the defined diet plan, the user has the option to generate a shopping list in PDF format, containing the necessary products for its implementation, divided into different categories (vegetables, fruits, baked goods, etc.).
